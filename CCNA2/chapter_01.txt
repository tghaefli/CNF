    Core: Backbone, Highspeed
    Distribution: Smart Layer, Routing, Filtering, QoS

Different apps have different requirements:
    - Latency
    - Bandwidth

Borderless switched network:
    - Hierarchical
    - Modularity
    - Resiliency
    - Flexibility

Switching:
    - Only send package to destination IP, to to all devices

Switched Network:   - Traffic managment (can prefere Voice over other packages)
                    - More flexible
                    - Firewall
                    - Limit Bandwidth on a port



Switch: All devices want to connect to the internet --> 1 port (to router) is occupied
        Buffer in the switch stores Frames and forwards them once the port is open

Store and Forward:  Receive whole package --> Read CRC and Dest-IP --> Forward Package
                    | Preamble | MAC_D | MAC_S | .... | FCS (=CRC) |
                    bigger latency
                    Less bandwidth, because false frames are dropped and not forwarded
                    FCS (Frame Check Sum - CRC)
Cut Trough:         Wait for Dest-IP, once IP is valid forward every bit it still receives
                    small latency
Standart:           Mix of both
                    Store packages when port is busy
