Communication is between Transport layers in segments. They don't know the other 3 layers


Manchaster: (0 sig: from 0 to 1  // 1 sig: from 1 to 0)
	- requires 2x the bandwith
	+ no DC --> galv. trennung (Coupler, the higher f --> the smaller the coil)
	+ syncronisation is easier

NRZ (non returning zero)
	oppsite of Manchaster

300Hz - 6kHz is required for clear communication and direction detection

FM (Freq. Modulation, analog) = FSK (digital)

Rec_Signal = Send_Signal + Noise

UTP: Unshielded Twisted Pair
STP:   Shielded Twisted Pair
Coax: Best media


10 Mbit: 2 pairs (only 50% of cable)
 1 Gbit: 4 pairs


Straighttrough:	Both sides same standarts 	network-host
Crossover:		different standarts			network-network

Cablecom:	1GHz because of Coax
	        10^x with fiber
Swisscom:	1MHz because of DSL

LWL: Lichtwellen leiter (Fiber)

Wireless media
	Wifi: Only 1 enddevice can send at a time, else it gets scrambled
	Bluetooth
	Wimax (death)

Halfduplex:	One device can send per time
Fullduplex:	Both devices can send per time
Simplex:	...
Multiplex:	...


Token Ring: Bitmuster wird von PC zu PC weitergegeben
			PC mit Token kann fÃ¼r eine Zeit lang senden
			Bus-Topology, end points are connected together --> Ring-Topology


CSMA/CD: 	Switch - Router
CSMA/CA: 	WLAN Node - End devices (Laptop)

bandwith: 	capacity to carry data


Multimode: 	cheap: LED as light source
			several paths for light
			short distance (LAN)

Singlenode:	Laser as lightsource
			long distance (WAN)
