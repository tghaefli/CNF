IP is not reliable, TCP make it reliable with Ack

TCP/IP Model:
	Application Layer:
		(T)FTP, SMTP, HTTP, DNS,
	Transport:
		TCP, UDP
	Internet:
		IP
	Network Access:
		LAN, WLAN

OIS Model:
	....

TCP: reliable, bigger overhead, Package-Nbr, Port-Nbr (Mail, Webpage)
UDP: unreliable, small overhead, Package-Nbr, Port-Nbr (phone, video)  ==> Higher Performance

TCP was sucessful because of Flowcontrol:
	Ensure the reciver has buffer-space and is not overloaded
	Change Transmissionrate
	Change Package size

Ports can seperate Application (51112 --> Firefox, 61242 --> Deluge, ...)
OS handels the source(appication) ports

0     -  1023: well known ports
1024  - 49151: reigstered port
49152 - 65535: open ports

Source Port: Random
Destination Port: Known port

TCP open connection: 3 way handshake  with SYN --> SYN,ACK --> ACK 
TCP close connection: 3 way handshake with FIN--> ack, ack <-- FIN	(is a flag)
