Ethernetframe: Layer 1 and 2

Ethernet: Most widely used LAN technology

FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF	broadcast mac address
255:255:255:255		broadcast IP address

promiscous mode:	don't throw packages away


0000 :	Class A
1000 :	Class B (10. )
1100 :	Class C
1110 :	Class D (127. )

CIDR: Claseless

An Ethernet switch is a Layer 2 device, which means it uses MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions.
It is completely unaware of the protocol being carried in the data portion of the frame, such as an IPv4 packet.


Switch: Modern Hub, has a buffer for each physical port output.

Switch: Check CRC -->	if correct: forward it
						if wrong: throw package away


ARP spoofing:	change mac addresses associated to their IP
