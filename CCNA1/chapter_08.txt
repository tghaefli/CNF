HOW TO REMOVE MALWARE?
MAKE THE WINDOW OPEN AND *SWOOOSH*


192.168.1.0 / 24
	192.168.1.0  -127
	192.168.1.128-255
Subnet: 255.255.255.128

Subnet can not be 1111'1111.1100'1111.xxx, It must be all towards the left

IPv6:	Always 64Bit Network // 64Bit Host (very easy!)
		We can split up the address, but it's not done

		48bits Global Routing Prefix	> =64 bits
		16bits Subnet ID				   ^
		64bits Interfaces ID / End Devices

		Always use x*4Bits for Subnetting with IPv4 --> think big (0 to F)

30 Hosts = 2^x > 30 --> x=5 Bits
