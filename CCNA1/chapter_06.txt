Layer 3 Network:	IPv4, IPv6

Transport Layter PDU = Segment
	| Segment Header | Data |

IP Protocol: 	Conectionless: No connection with the destination is established before sending data packets.
				Best effort: IP is inherently unreliable because packet delivery is not guaranteed.
				Media Independet: Operation is independent of the medium (i.e., copper, fiber optic, or wireless) carrying the data.


IPv4: 	Version "0100"

IPv6:	Version "0110"
	HOP limit = TTL
	Flow label: ......

gateway: Routs traffic to another network


RAM:	Running IOS
		Racket buffer
		routing table / arp table
NVRAM:	Startup configuratin File
Flash:	IOS
ROM:	Bootup information
		power-on self-test (POST)


AUX port:	Ethernet port
Console:	RJ45 / USB


Bootup:	IOS from Flash --> RAM
		start-up config from NVMRAM --> running config in RAM








Network Layer (IP Layer) is Software, compatible all over the world
